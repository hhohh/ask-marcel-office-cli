 * Shared URL-shape detector used by the four `resolve-*` commands to

 * audit Jane-session §B baseline shipped — extended here to cover
 * teams + drive-share, closing the 5-gap matrix flagged in the
 * v1.4.0 re-audit Nit 1).
 *
 * Atelier note: callers MUST validate the URL through Zod's `z.url()`
 * BEFORE invoking these predicates. `new URL(raw)` would throw on a
 * malformed input, and try/catch is forbidden outside `src/infra/**` —
 * every resolver's schema validation already guarantees a valid URL by
 * the time the parse step runs.
