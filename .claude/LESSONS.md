## [gotcha] 2026-05-06 | elevated capture deadline must accommodate federated-IdP interactive auth

The first elevated-token capture in `src/infra/browser-auth.ts` capped the poll deadline at 60 s, assuming silent SSO would always succeed via persistent profile cookies. On Okta-fronted tenants (e.g. ExampleCorp) the Okta passive WS-Fed session expires every few hours, after which `m365.cloud.microsoft/*` redirects through `okta.<tenant>.com/.../sso/wsfed/passive` and stays there pending interactive sign-in. 60 s is not enough — bump the deadline to the full `pollDeadlineMs` (5 min default) so the user has time to finish the Okta dance inside the visible Edge popup.
Affects: `src/infra/browser-auth.ts` `acquireElevatedToken`; any tenant where the Microsoft-Graph IdP is federated to a third party with shorter session lifetimes than Microsoft's own SSO.

## [decision] 2026-05-06 | use `m365.cloud.microsoft/search` as the elevated-capture URL

`https://m365.cloud.microsoft` (root) sometimes lands on `/chat/blocked` or stalls on bootstrap; `/search` is a more reliable target — it forces a Graph-aud token issuance for OfficeHome (`4765445b-...`) and M365ChatClient (`c0ab8ce9-...`) within the first 5–8 seconds of `domcontentloaded`. Both appids are on `ELEVATED_APP_IDS`, so either matches the filter. Empirically verified with a Playwright bearer-trace probe.
Applies to: `src/infra/browser-auth.ts` `M365_CLOUD_URL`.

## [decision] 2026-05-06 | historical-version content needs an ODSP-allow-listed Graph token

The 3 historical-version commands (`download-drive-item-version-content`, `download-drive-item-version-as-markdown`, `download-drive-item-version-as-pdf`) cannot use the Teams web client token alone — the embedded tempauth in the returned `streamContent` URL fails ODSP's `logicalPermissions` allow-list and 403s. Login captures a *second* Graph token from `https://m365.cloud.microsoft` whose first-party identity is M365ChatClient (`c0ab8ce9-e9a0-42e7-b064-33d422df41f1`), an app on the allow-list. New commands hitting ODSP-gated endpoints must call `graph.getBinaryElevated`, not `graph.getBinary`.
Applies to: any future command that 403s with `logicalPermissionAccessDenied`.

## [gotcha] 2026-05-06 | m365.cloud.microsoft refuses headless Edge

Initial elevated-token capture used Playwright in headless mode against `https://m365.cloud.microsoft`. Microsoft's anti-automation served an interstitial / token-issuance loop never fired. Switching `launchContext` to `headless: false` (visible Edge window) made the silent-SSO + Graph-fetch path work end-to-end. The persistent profile cookies still do the SSO; only the chrome needs to be visible.
Affects: `src/infra/browser-auth.ts` `acquireElevatedToken` flow; the brief Edge popup at token expiry is intentional.

## [gotcha] 2026-05-06 | bun text coverage reporter omits line numbers above ~99%

When `bun test --coverage` reports a file at 99.x% but the per-tier 100% gate fails, the text reporter sometimes prints an empty `Uncovered Line #s` cell, leaving you blind. Switch the bunfig coverage reporter to `lcov`, re-run, and grep `coverage/lcov.info` for `DA:N,0` lines to find the exact missing line numbers. Used to spot line 186 of `auth.ts` (a closing `}` of a nested `if`) — the fix was flattening the nested if so the closing brace stopped existing as a separately-instrumented line.
Rule for next time: don't add throwaway tests for impossible branches; reshape the source so the uncovered line stops being a distinct instrumented unit.
