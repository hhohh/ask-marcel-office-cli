## [decision] 2026-05-29 | OOXML side-channel extraction composes on a shared `ooxml-*` core

docx/xlsx/pptx are all ZIP packages with byte-identical `docProps/{core,app,custom}.xml` and the same `*.rels` relationship graph. The metadata + image features share four format-agnostic modules: `src/infra/ooxml-zip-adapter.ts` (`openOoxmlZip`), `src/use-cases/commands/ooxml-xml-walker.ts` (fast-xml-parser traversal), `ooxml-metadata.ts` (core/app/custom props + all-`*.rels` external-link scan + VBA-macro flag), and `ooxml-metadata-to-markdown.ts` (render primitives). Per-format modules (`docx-metadata`, `xlsx-metadata`, `pptx-metadata`, …) own only body-specific extractors and compose the shared core. New OOXML work (ODF is the next zip-based candidate) must reuse these, not re-parse the zip.
Applies to: any future Office-document content/metadata feature.

## [decision] 2026-05-29 | `--include-metadata` appends for docx/xlsx, stands alone for pptx

The flag surfaces side-channel content (authored-but-not-rendered: properties, comments, tracked changes, speaker notes, hidden slides, defined names, VBA-macro presence). For formats with a convertible markdown body (docx via mammoth, xlsx via sheetjs) the metadata is appended as a `## … metadata` section. pptx has no markdown body in this CLI (it 415s toward `*-as-pdf`), so with the flag it returns the metadata as a *standalone* document and without it keeps the 415. Macro-enabled (`.docm`/`.xlsm`/`.pptm`) and template (`.dotx`/…) variants alias onto their base format via `office-extensions.ts`. New format metadata follows the same rule: append if there is a body, standalone if not.
Applies to: `office-to-markdown.ts`, `convert-mail-attachment-to-markdown.ts`, the `extract-*-images` family.

## [gotcha] 2026-05-29 | binary parts need a separate adapter from the metadata zip adapter

`ooxml-zip-adapter` pre-decodes every entry as a UTF-8 string (correct for XML, corrupting for binary images). Image extraction therefore uses a *separate* `src/infra/ooxml-media-extractor.ts` that returns raw `Uint8Array` per `*/media/*` part. Do not reuse the metadata adapter for binary content. The `--output-dir` flag mirrors `--output-path` (`persistMediaIfRequested` in `output-path.ts`) — single-file `--output-path` cannot split a `media` array across files.
Affects: any feature that pulls binary parts out of an OOXML package.

## [gotcha] 2026-05-29 | mutation: assert `error.type`, never guard on it

`if (!result.ok && result.error.type === 'api_error') expect(...)` lets a mutant that changes the error `type` skip the inner assertions — the test still passes, the mutant survives. This was the dominant cause of surviving mutants across the image feature. Assert the discriminant directly: `expect(result.ok).toBe(false); if (result.ok) return; expect(result.error.type).toBe('api_error');`. Also add a non-`io_failed` write-error case to kill the `type === 'io_failed' ? message : type` ternary survivors in `output-path.ts`.
Applies to: every `Result`-returning use-case test.

## [gotcha] 2026-05-29 | Stryker incremental cache lies after test-only changes; 1-element `.toSorted` is an uncovered fn

Two traps hit while mutation-testing: (1) `incremental: true` in `stryker.conf.json` serves *stale cached verdicts* when only test files change (finishes in seconds, scores don't move) and the report also lists cached unrelated files — `rm -f reports/stryker-incremental.json` (or scope `--mutate` to specific files) for an honest re-measure. (2) A `.toSorted((a,b) => …)` over a *single-element* array never invokes the comparator, so the comparator shows as an uncovered function even at 100% line coverage — drop the sort until there are ≥2 elements.
Affects: `bun run mutate:changed`, any manifest-derived list (`mediaProducingCommands` in `cli.ts`).

## [gotcha] 2026-05-06 | elevated capture deadline must accommodate federated-IdP interactive auth

The first elevated-token capture in `src/infra/browser-auth.ts` capped the poll deadline at 60 s, assuming silent SSO would always succeed via persistent profile cookies. On Okta-fronted tenants (e.g. ExampleCorp) the Okta passive WS-Fed session expires every few hours, after which `m365.cloud.microsoft/*` redirects through `okta.<tenant>.com/.../sso/wsfed/passive` and stays there pending interactive sign-in. 60 s is not enough — bump the deadline to the full `pollDeadlineMs` (5 min default) so the user has time to finish the Okta dance inside the visible Edge popup.
Affects: `src/infra/browser-auth.ts` `acquireElevatedToken`; any tenant where the Microsoft-Graph IdP is federated to a third party with shorter session lifetimes than Microsoft's own SSO.

## [decision] 2026-05-06 | use `m365.cloud.microsoft/search` as the elevated-capture URL

`https://m365.cloud.microsoft` (root) sometimes lands on `/chat/blocked` or stalls on bootstrap; `/search` is a more reliable target — it forces a Graph-aud token issuance for OfficeHome (`4765445b-...`) and M365ChatClient (`c0ab8ce9-...`) within the first 5–8 seconds of `domcontentloaded`. Both appids are on `ELEVATED_APP_IDS`, so either matches the filter. Empirically verified with a Playwright bearer-trace probe.
Applies to: `src/infra/browser-auth.ts` `M365_CLOUD_URL`.

## [decision] 2026-05-06 | historical-version content needs an ODSP-allow-listed Graph token

The 3 historical-version commands (`download-drive-item-version-content`, `download-drive-item-version-as-markdown`, `download-drive-item-version-as-pdf`) cannot use the Teams web client token alone — the embedded tempauth in the returned `streamContent` URL fails ODSP's `logicalPermissions` allow-list and 403s. Login captures a *second* Graph token from `https://m365.cloud.microsoft` whose first-party identity is M365ChatClient (`c0ab8ce9-e9a0-42e7-b064-33d422df41f1`), an app on the allow-list. New commands hitting ODSP-gated endpoints must call `graph.getBinaryElevated`, not `graph.getBinary`.
Applies to: any future command that 403s with `logicalPermissionAccessDenied`.

## [gotcha] 2026-05-06 | m365.cloud.microsoft refuses headless Edge

Initial elevated-token capture used Playwright in headless mode against `https://m365.cloud.microsoft`. Microsoft's anti-automation served an interstitial / token-issuance loop never fired. Switching `launchContext` to `headless: false` (visible Edge window) made the silent-SSO + Graph-fetch path work end-to-end. The persistent profile cookies still do the SSO; only the chrome needs to be visible.
Affects: `src/infra/browser-auth.ts` `acquireElevatedToken` flow; the brief Edge popup at token expiry is intentional.

## [gotcha] 2026-05-06 | bun text coverage reporter omits line numbers above ~99%

When `bun test --coverage` reports a file at 99.x% but the per-tier 100% gate fails, the text reporter sometimes prints an empty `Uncovered Line #s` cell, leaving you blind. Switch the bunfig coverage reporter to `lcov`, re-run, and grep `coverage/lcov.info` for `DA:N,0` lines to find the exact missing line numbers. Used to spot line 186 of `auth.ts` (a closing `}` of a nested `if`) — the fix was flattening the nested if so the closing brace stopped existing as a separately-instrumented line.
Rule for next time: don't add throwaway tests for impossible branches; reshape the source so the uncovered line stops being a distinct instrumented unit.
